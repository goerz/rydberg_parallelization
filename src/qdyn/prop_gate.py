    r'''Yield gates in `gates_file`, where `gates_file` is in the format
    written by the ``qdyn_prop_gate`` utility's ``--write-gate`` option. That
    is, each row in `gates_files` has $2 n^2 + 1$ columns. The first column is
    a time stamp, the remaining columns are the real and imaginary part for
    each entry in the $n \times n$ gate (vectorized in column-major format). If
    `with_t` is False (default), yield only the gates, otherwise yield both the
    gates and the time stamp for each gate

    Returns:
        * If ``with_t=False``, iterator over gates, where each gate is a
          complex $n \times n$ numpy matrix, or a Gate2Q instance for a $4
          \times 4$ gate
        * If ``with_t=True``, iterator of tuples ``(gate, t)``, where ``t`` is
          a float or an instance of UnitFloat if the time unit can be derived
          from the header of `gates_file`
